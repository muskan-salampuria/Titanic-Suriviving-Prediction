# Titanic-Suriviving-Prediction
> The obective of this Project is to Predict whether the Passenger is Survived or Not.  
> Naive Bayes Algorithm is Used.

## Approach
> - Read Titanic file in csv format and make a dataframe
> - Drop uneccessary columns
> - Convert text columns into binary format and merge them in the dataframe
> - Drop text columns
> - Replace all null values in a columns with the  mean value.
> - Split test train dataset( 80% training data and 20% testing data)
> - Gaussian Naive Bayes model is made and trained.
> - Predict the values

## Result
> Score Calculated is 
> You can also calculate Probabilities.
